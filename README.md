# CS165L-Project-Library-Management-System

The aim of this project is to build a web app that will serve as a modern and user-friendly interface for accessing our library's extensive collection of books and resources. This web app will provide patrons with an efficient way to search for books, check their availability, and even reserve or renew them online. The project will prioritize user convenience and security, ensuring that patrons can access our services seamlessly from their smartphones or computers. Additionally, the web app will incorporate features for tracking popular books and analyzing library usage, ultimately enhancing the overall library experience for our users.
